# odin-recipes
The current project is to write a recipe home page with links to recipe pages. This is to
demonstrate knowledge of the html boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, images, relative links, and git.

The project has been updated with css now that showcases css properties like border, color, background-color, text-align, margin, width, font-family, and padding. Practiced using css selectors with specificity and cascade ruling for class and type.
